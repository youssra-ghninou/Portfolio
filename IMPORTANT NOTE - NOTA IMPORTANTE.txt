IMPORTANT NOTE - Description English 

* Modify the project

Just add your information in the HTML file and leave the project like this.

If you are going to modify the project in the CSS file, do it normally.

If you are going to modify the project with the sass files, I recommend 
watching my video on how to use Sass and my setup for the projects. 
If you already know Sass and have your own setup, you can skip the video.

*Favicon

If you want to create your favicon, do it in any design tool
(I recommend figma, it's easier) and export it with the size of 32px.

* Images of projects

When you insert the images of your projects, keep in mind that they must measure 
in a rectangular format (eg: 600 x 400, 1000 x 800, 1200 x 1000, etc).

* Contact buttons

In the image of button contact home that comes in the folder it is shown in 
the red boxes that you must modify and insert your real data. Open the HTML 
file and modify.
